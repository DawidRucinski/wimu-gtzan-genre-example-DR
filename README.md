# GTZAN genre classification example

This example is based on the excellent [Music Classification: Beyond Supervised Learning, Towards Real-world Applications](https://music-classification.github.io/tutorial/part3_supervised/tutorial.html) by Minz Won, Janne Spijkervet and Keunwoo Choi.

The code has a couple of structural changes, but it does basically the same as the supervised learning example: music genre classification on GTZAN using a convnet.
